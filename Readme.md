This is a simple TDD project to demonstrate FizzBuzz.

Start with the number 1 and increment by 1 to 100.
If the number is divisible by 3 then print Fizz.
If the number is divisible by 5 then print Buzz.
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 then print FizzBuzz.
Otherwise, print the number.

For example,
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
